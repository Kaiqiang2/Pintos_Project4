changed : src/devices/timer.c
function timer_sleep(ticks)
changed so that
the thread is added to the sleep_list
current thread is blocked

changes to be made:
timer_interrupt occurs, than wake up blocked thread, remove from sleep list, add to ready list, unblock.
this is to be done at the function called from timer_interrupt, i guess; timer_interrupt function itself is called at certain ticks, so it is not to be called at function timer_sleep.
